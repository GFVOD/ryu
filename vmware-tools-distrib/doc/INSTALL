INSTALLING/UPGRADING

  To install/upgrade VMware Tools for Linux,
  run the program "vmware-install.pl" from a command prompt, either in text
  mode or from a terminal inside an X session. You must have super user
  privileges (i.e. be logged as root) to run it.

     ./vmware-install.pl

  If you are installing VMware Tools for the first time,
  you can hit the <enter> key each time you are prompted to select the
  factory default answer. By default,
  the installation program installs:
       the executables         in /usr/bin,
       the server executables  in /usr/sbin,
       the library files       in /usr/lib/vmware-tools,
   and the documentation files in /usr/share/doc/vmware-tools.

  If you have previously installed VMware Tools,
  you can hit the <enter> key each time you are prompted to keep your previous
  answer, or you can decide to submit a new answer.

  Once the installation/upgrade is complete, you can safely remove the
  vmware-tools-distrib directory from your system.

CONFIGURING

  In order to run correctly, VMware Tools must first be configured.

  To configure VMware Tools, run the program "vmware-config-tools.pl" (this is
  automatically done for you at the end of the installation/upgrade
  process if you answer "yes" to the last question). You must have super user
  privileges (i.e. be logged as root) to run it.

     vmware-config-tools.pl

  This will teach VMware Tools how to run on your current Linux kernel.
  If you reboot your machine with a new kernel that VMware Tools
  doesn't know yet (because, let's say, you have upgraded your Linux system),
  you will have to run this configuration program again.
  Then, VMware Tools will know this new kernel once and for all.

UNINSTALLING

  To remove an existing installation, run the program
  "vmware-uninstall-tools.pl".
  You must have super user privileges (i.e. be logged as root) to run it.

     vmware-uninstall-tools.pl

  The uninstall process will delete all installed files, and will backup the
  files that have been modified since they have been installed.
